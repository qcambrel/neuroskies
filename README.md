# Neuroskies

Neuroskies is a project synthesizing concepts from scientific data visualization, evolutionary computation, and video super resolution. Watch forecast variables evolve leveraging evolutionary algorithms like Nevergrad and PSO. Render coherent video of your forecasts utilizing frame upscaling and frame interpolation powered by Lanczos resampling and pretrained VSR models. Potentially, there may even be an implementation of photorealistic rendering in the future.
